# ðŸŒŽ Airon â€” Real-Time Global AQI Predictor

Airon is a full-stack machine learning web app that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) of any country in real time. It fetches air pollutant data using OpenWeather APIs and makes predictions using a trained Random Forest model.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

This project was a personal breakthrough. I transitioned from basic ML scripting to building a real-world full-stack application. I learned:

- How to connect APIs to ML workflows
- Fundamentals of REST APIs and using Flask for backend
- Frontend development with React and TypeScript
- How to structure a project from prototype to production
